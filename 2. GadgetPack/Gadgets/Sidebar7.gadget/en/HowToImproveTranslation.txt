Hi,
the localization of your language may be mixed with some english texts. You are welcome to complete the translation!
Go one folder up, then to the folder with your languagecode, open Localized.js with a texteditor and translate the english texts (only text between two "quotation marks"). You can also check the existing translation for errors.

Dont forget to send me the file via the feedback button or to 7sidebar [at] web.de ;) 

Thanks!
